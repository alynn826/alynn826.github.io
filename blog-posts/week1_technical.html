			<h3 class="header">Guild Wars 2</h3>

				<a href="http://www.guildwars2.com"><img src="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/thumbnails/blog_1952/pt_1952_2737_o.jpg?t=1347585139"/></a>

				<p>For a game as beautiful as Guild Wars 2, one is almost suprised to find its website to be so bland.  It is a clean streamlined site that is easy to navigate and it delivers the game news/updates like it's meant to do. I think the User Experience is good here since it does provide you with all the information you need about the game delivered in a straightforward manner.  Design is good in that the layout is simple and uncluttered.  However, after being on the site for a while it felt boring.  Not particularly inspiring for a game that has won many awards.</p>
			<h3 class="header">Trader Joe's</h3>

				<a href="http://www.traderjoes.com"><img src="http://www.traderjoes.com/images/Logo_static.png"/></a>

				<p>Trader Joe's website is as busy and quirky as its brick and mortar stores.  Interestingly enough I think this website has the opposite problem as the Guild Wars' site in that while it's visually fun to look at, at times its navigation isn't the most intuitive.  For the uninitiated, they would not know what "Dig In" means food blog on the Navbar.  I also found the "Customer Updates" under the "About Us" which didn't make sense since it really should be under the "Product News" page.  Even when I worked at Trader Joe's I had to guess where some of the buttons would take me when I clicked on them. The strength of this site is that it is fun to look at and does have all the information a customer would want if the customer can find where it is.</p>

			<h3 class="header">Airbnb</h3>

				<a href="http://www.airbnb.com"><img src="http://cdn.confreaks.com/system/events/logos/94/airbnb_logo_1-original.jpg?1357508996"/></a>

				<p>This website has a good balance between design and user experience in my opinion.  It is clean, elegant, and easy to navigate.  It is a site that's suppose to sell you the idea that renting other people's home is a good alternative to hotels and it delivers it well.  Not only does it have the tools for you to search for rentals, it also offers you plenty of information on neighborhoods and safety.  When I first heard about Airbnb I was a bit leery about renting other people's home but after visiting the website I felt comfortable enough to book my first rental and that certainly is a sign of a well designed website. It gave me plenty of options, answered questions I had, and easy to navigate.  </p>

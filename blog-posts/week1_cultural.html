			<p>In this blog I will be discussing some of my expectations and takes on how the DBC experience will be after watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video. </p>

			<h3 class="header">My Take on the DBC Experience</h3>

				<p>I think Shereef's video definitely reflect the core values that set DBC apart from the traditional schools. It isn't surprising that he wants the students to treat DBC more than just a "product" we're purchasing but rather an experiment we're all contributing to.  I think DBC will be one of the most difficult and yet fulfilling experiences for its students. It's very easy to be comfortable and complacent in one's life and DBC seems to be built to challenge that.</p>

			<h3 class="header">My Expectations of DBC</h3>

				<p>I certainly appreciate Shereef's bluntness in terms of the level of stress and hardwork involved in DBC.  I don't think my expectation for DBC has changed since from day one I have heard how much time is required each week to complete the assignments.  I expected DBC to challenge my brain and willpower in a way I've never been before. Frankly I am quite nervous about it since I had a secure and well paid job before and I am worried that I might want to take the "easy" way out if it gets too hard.  I have always tackled challenges head on no matter how difficult and although math and science has never been my forte, I hope I will overcome my fear and be an active contributor to this exciting learning experience.</p>

			<h3 class="header">How Do I See Myself in DBC</h3>

				<p>To be honest I think if I can maintain the mindset that I am there to be a part of something greater than just a "9 week quick career change" I will be able to overcome most challenges. I would like to be a curious and active contributor to the cohort and not just someone there to program. </p>

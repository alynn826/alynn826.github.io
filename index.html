	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>Hello DBC! It's great to meet everyone here! My name is Ann and I'm originally from California but currently lives on Maui.<br> I've worked as a Project Manager for Cisco Systems and Store Manager for Trader Joe's so you can say I've gone from one<br>end of the spectrum to the other.  I'm excited to be embarking on this new adventure and look forward to working with all of you.</p>

	<h3>What I Hope to Gain from DBC</h3>
		<p>I want to be able to not just create beautiful webpages, but also interactive web apps that's accessible to everyone.  Ultimately<br> I want to become a successful freelance web developer who can see the world and still take the job with me.</p>

	<h3>My Interests</h3>
		<p>Being on Maui, hiking is a big part of the culture.  Some of my favorite trails are: the Pipiwai trail in Haleakala National Park<br>and the Commando Trail along Hana Highway</p>

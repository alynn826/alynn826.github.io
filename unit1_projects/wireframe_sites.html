	<p>For the Trader Joe's web page it is addressing the problem of how to get the endusers to try their private labeled products, where to find those products, and finally how to use the products. With Trader Joe's being known for its quirky flair as well as food products being mainly visually driven, it's very easy for the web page to be cluttered and possibly difficult to navigate for the enduser.</p>

	<p>For the Guild Wars 2 web page the challenge is to showcase the visual beauty and playability of the game as well as relaying releases of game updates.  I think the visual challenge here is whether they can sufficiently portray the beauty of the game. The web page is a little bland in my opinion considering the game itself is quite stunning graphically. It needs to feature the game play videos and screenshots more prominently.</P>

	<p>For the Airbnb webpage they are trying to convey to the endusers the appeal of renting someone's home for vacation over the usual hotels and assuring them it's a safe unique experience.  The visual challenge here is trying to showcase as many locales as possible without making the website looking cluttered and difficult to navigate.</p>

		<p id="intro">Aloha my fellow boots! My name is Ann and I am part of the Chicago cohort.  It's a pleasure to be amongst people who are all working towards the same goal. I look forward to learn and grow with everyone here as we embark on this journey together!</p>
		
		<h1 class="headers">About Me</h1>
			<p>I grew up in Souther California but have also lived in Pennsylvania, Texas, and now I currenly live in Hawaii.  I decided to enroll in DBC because I wanted to have a skill that I can take anywhere with me no matter where I live.
			</p>
		<h2 class="headers">What I Hope to Be When I Grow Up (a.k.a after DBC)</h2>
			<p>You can say I've always been a free spirit so I wanted to be able to just pick up and travel without worrying about how am I going to support myself.  I believe being a Web Devleper will give me the freedom no other job can</p>

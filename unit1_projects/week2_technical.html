			<h3 class="header">Block</h3>

				<p>Before discussing inline and inline-block display, it's important to know about blocks. Blocks are elements that are like boxes.  Each block takes up the entire line and will not allow another box to sit next to it on the same line.</p>

			<h3 class="header">Inline</h3>

				<p>To display inline elements means elements are able to be next to each other on the same line (unlike block which takes up the entire line and won't let anything sit next to it) but they are not formatted like a block box.  There are no margins between the elements and height/width cannot be set.</p>
			
			<h3 class="header">Inline-Blocks</h3>

				<p>To display inline-block elements means the elements are block boxes that can sit next to each other on the same line. Width and height can be set because the elements are block boxes.  Think of it as a combination of both block and inline.  </p>
